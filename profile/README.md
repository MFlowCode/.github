## Welcome to the MFC Github organization! ðŸ‘‹

MFC is an extreme-scale simulation code for handling multi-component, multi-phase, and bubbly flows (and more!). 
The main repositories are pinned below.
The main-release repository is `MFC` and the development repo. is `MFC-develop`.
There is a [user guide](https://github.com/MFlowCode/MFC/raw/master/doc/MFC_user_guide.pdf) and [documentation](https://mflowcode.github.io/simulation/namespaces.html) to get you started.
Another good resource is the `README.md` in the repositories. 
If you have questions, you can contact the maintainers (e.g., [Spencer Bryngelson](mailto:shb@gatech.edu)) and/or request to join the MFC Slack workspace.
