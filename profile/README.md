## Welcome to the MFC Github organization! ðŸ‘‹

MFC simulates compressible multi-phase flows at extreme (exascale!) computational scales.
* MFC nucleated from the Colonius research group at Caltech.
These days, development and maintenance have spread. 
  * The  <a href="https://comp-physics.group">Bryngelson Group</a> at Georgia Tech maintains MFC and its algorithmic and HPC aspects.
  * Many new physics features often come from close collaborators, like the groups of <a href="https://colonius.caltech.edu/">Tim Colonius</a> (Caltech) and <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/mrodri97">Mauro Rodriguez</a> (Brown).
* The release MFC [repository](https://github.com/MFlowCode/MFC) is pinned below.
* MFC has many features, see them [here](https://github.com/MFlowCode/MFC/blob/master/README.md). For example, it scales to _tens of thousands_ of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs with ideal weak scaling.
* There is [documentation](https://mflowcode.github.io/) to get you started!
* If you have questions, you can contact the maintainers (e.g., [Spencer Bryngelson](mailto:shb@gatech.edu)) and/or request to join the MFC Slack workspace (email Spencer for an invite).
