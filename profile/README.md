## Welcome to the MFC Github organization! ðŸ‘‹

MFC is an extreme-scale simulation code for handling compressible multi-phase flows. 
* MFC nucleated from the Colonius research group at Caltech.
Now it is developed and maintained by the groups of Professors <a href="https://comp-physics.group">Spencer Bryngelson</a>, <a href="https://colonius.caltech.edu/">Tim Colonius</a>, and <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/mrodri97">Mauro Rodriguez</a> (alpha by last name).
* The main repositories are pinned below.
The release repository is `MFC` and some use-at-your-own-risk developments live in `MFC-develop`.
There is [documentation](https://mflowcode.github.io/) to get you started!
* MFC has many nice features (in our view). For example, it scales to _tens of thousands_ of GPUs with ideal weak scaling.
* If you have questions, you can contact the maintainers (e.g., [Spencer Bryngelson](mailto:shb@gatech.edu)) and/or request to join the MFC Slack workspace (email Spencer for an invite).
