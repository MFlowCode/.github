## Welcome to the MFC Github organization! ðŸ‘‹

MFC is an extreme-scale simulation code for handling multi-component, multi-phase, and bubbly flows (and more!). 
* MFC nucleated from the Colonius research group at Caltech.
Now it is developed and maintained by the groups of Professors <a href="https://comp-physics.group">Spencer Bryngelson</a>, <a href="https://colonius.caltech.edu/">Tim Colonius</a>, and <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/mrodri97">Mauro Rodriguez</a> (alpha by last name).
* The main repositories are pinned below.
The main-release repository is `MFC` and the development repo. is `MFC-develop`.
There is a [user guide](https://github.com/MFlowCode/MFC/raw/master/doc/MFC_user_guide.pdf) and [documentation](https://mflowcode.github.io/simulation/namespaces.html) to get you started.
Another good resource is the `README.md` in the repositories. 
* MFC has many nice features (in our view). For example, it scales to _tens of thousands_ of GPUs with ideal weak scaling.
* If you have questions, you can contact the maintainers (e.g., [Spencer Bryngelson](mailto:shb@gatech.edu)) and/or request to join the MFC Slack workspace.
